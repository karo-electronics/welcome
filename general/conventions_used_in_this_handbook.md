# Conventions Used

The following conventions are used in this documentation:

* **Bold**  
  is used for statements and functions, identifiers, and program names.

* _Italic_
	is used for file and directory names when they appear in the body of a
	paragraph as well as for data types and to emphasize new terms and
	concepts when they are introduced.

* `Constant Width`
	 is used in examples to show the contents of files or the output from
	 commands.

* **`Constant Bold`**
	 is used in examples to show command lines and options that should be
	 typed literally, or even better copy and pasted, by the user. (For
	 example, **rm foo** means to type “**rm foo**” exactly as it appears in the
	 text or the example.)

* `""`
	are used to identify a code fragment in explanatory text. System
	messages and symbols are quoted as well.

* `$`
	is the UNIX Bourne shell or Korn shell prompt.

* `<>`
	surrounds **parameter** elements in a description of program syntax. (The
	brackets themselves should never be typed, unless otherwise noted.)

* `[]`
	surrounds **optional** elements in a description of program syntax. (The
	brackets themselves should never be typed, unless otherwise noted.)

* `...`
	stands for text (usually computer output) that’s been omitted for
	clarity or to save space.

* `□`
	indicates a literal space. This symbol is used to make spaces visible
	in examples, as well as in the text.

* `•`
	indicates a literal TAB character. This symbol is used to make tabs
	visible in examples, as well as in the text.

The notation `CTRL-X` or `^X` indicates use of control characters. It
means hold down the “control” key while typing the character `x`. We
denote other keys similarly (e.g., `RETURN` indicates a carriage
return). All examples of command lines are followed by a `RETURN` unless
otherwise indicated.

Where follows that [keys] are:

```console
META-X  == M-X
        == ALT-X

SUPER-X == WIN-X

HYPER-X == MENU-X
```
