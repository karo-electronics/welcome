# Welcome to Ka-Ro at Github

## Ka-Ro TX6 Series for NXP i.MX 6 Processors

Ka-Ro TX6 modules are available for a complete range of NXP i.MX 6 processors. All modules in the TX family are pin-compatible, making it easy to create a product platform with different features or upgrading for more performance. 

Ka-Ro TX6 modules are designed and made in Germany for the highest possible quality.  Ka-Ro offers Technical Support directly from design engineers and developers, and provides guaranteed long-term availability to ensure extended product lifecycles. 

Support for TX6 modules is available for Linux and Microsoft Windows Embedded Compact. Third-party support is available for Android and QNX.  

### On Github we provide access to these main areas:
#### 1. U-Boot
  - Support for U-Boot on TXCOM modules - [karo-tx-uboot](https://github.com/karo-electronics/karo-tx-uboot) - [Wiki pages](https://github.com/karo-electronics/karo-tx-uboot/wiki)
  
#### 2. Linux Mainline Kernel
The main difference between Mainline Linux and the proprietary NXP kernel are the GPU drivers. Vivante GPU drivers are only available as closed source binary blobs. Unfortunatele these are not compatible to common Linux standards but are still required for full GPU functionality. An evolving open-source alternative called Etnaviv is used for mainline Linux which might be the choice in the future.
